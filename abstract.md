# Abstract

Introduction and reminder about cool and useful features to do test-driven development (TDD)

* [ ] ASimpleParserTest.java
   * [ ] TemporaryFolder
   * [ ] ClassRule
   * [ ] Before/After - BeforeClass/AfterClass
   * [ ] Test / Ignore
   * [ ] Java8 - File NIO
* [ ] AnotherBeanSimpleTest.java
   * [ ] Datapoint - single arguments / Theories - cannot be combined with regular Test annotation
* [ ] AnotherBeanTest.java
   * [ ] Datapoint - List<Value>, unfortunately no map possible / Theories - better error messages
   * [ ] Hamcrest - simple matcher
* [ ] ExpectingExceptionsTest.java   
   * [ ] old-style
   * [ ] very old-style
   * [ ] Rule: ExpectingExceptions, with cool error messages
* [ ] LookupServiceTest
   * [ ] Matchers / hamcrest, nice error messages
* [ ] CategoriesMarkerTests
   * [ ] Categories, define your own suites
* Lombok
   * [ ] OccurrenceFinder - count stuff without apache.commons or Guava :-)
   * [ ] UrlConnector - a very slim POJO
* Mockito
   * [ ] MockTests: 
      * automatic injection, verification: streams are closed
      * write your own matcher
   * [ ] TestingSystemOutPrintlnTest
      * verifying calls to System.out.println()
